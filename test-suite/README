In test1.slk, I just test various instructions to make sure they were being properly translated to the slko and then executed in the assembler.

I used sample1 and sample2 to make sure that my crucial functions were working and producing the correct output. 

I used the convtest file to test my conversions to make sure they were working correctly.

The test labels essentially made sure that my labels had correct functionality.
